This repository contains the input files of the paper mentioned above. The folder "Unbiased-isolated-molecule" contains input files for each polymorphs.  The simulations of each isolated molecule generate data for multi-class HLDA. The folder "Biased simulation solid" contains input files for WT-MetaD simulation starting from the epsilon form.
