# CVs-Conformational-Polymorphism
This repository contains the input files for the paper "Collective Variables for Conformational Polymorphism in Molecular Crystals."

The folder "Unbiased-isolated-molecule" contains input files for each polymorphs.  The simulations of each isolated molecule generate data for multi-class HLDA.

The folder "Biased simulation solid" contains input files for WT-MetaD simulation starting from the epsilon form.
